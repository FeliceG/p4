##Description
This website collects paper and poster submissions for the Coaching in Leadership and Healthcare 2016 to be considered for presentation at the Coaching conference in September 2016. Users login, provide research and author information, which will be reviewed and judged in August. Following this class, I will try to implement a view for "reviewers" to rate the submissions.

##Details for teaching team
This application associates a user email with a submission author email. At this time, a user can only make one submission. Following this course, the code will be updated so users/authors can submit more than one paper and/or poster.

##Outside code
fzanitto/Faker used to generate all fake data in this application.
kenwheeler/slick is used to create the image gallery on the Poster Page.
