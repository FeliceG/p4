<p><span class="bold">TITLE: </span> Warrior Coaching: Encounters with Military Leaders and Officials<br>
<span class="bold">AUTHOR: </span> Phil Brown, Six Points Consulting<br>
<span class="bold">ABSTRACT: </span>  <span class="more">Coaches face decisions every day concerning the successes and need for improvements
  in their areas of responsibility and themselves personally. The emergence of coaching
  as a professional development arena demands focused attention to appreciate the means
  to implement it in a meaningful and beneficial manner. Although specific definitions,
  reasons for engaging a coach, and methodologies and models to deploy coaching remain
  elusive, all seem to center on relationships to develop skills, help correct lagging
  skills, or concentrate on personal development. This paper concentrates on work with
  an under-served and under-studied population set – senior military officials. The
  intent of this study is to offer insights to the values, culture, and needs of this
  group, and those like them, and present a way to enhance coaches’ style to work nimbly
  with this group. It is a method to increase the effectiveness of a tailored coaching
  intervention and address non-routine and exciting people.</span></p>

  A new complementary approach in the clinics<br>
<span class="bold">AUTHOR:</span> Ayse Basak Cinar, University of Dundee, Dental Hospital and School<br>
<span class="bold">ABSTRACT:</span> <span class="more">To compare internationally the effectiveness of health coaching (HC) versus
health education (HE) on oral health and diabetes management among patients with diabetes
type 2 (T2DM). METHOD: T2DM patients in Turkey and Denmark were randomized to HC and HE groups.
Clinical outcomes and health behaviours were analyzed as outcome measures.</span></p>


<p><span class="bold">TITLE: </span>Using Motivational Interviewing in Coaching: A Theoretical Discussion<br>
<span class="bold">AUTHORS: </span>Cherry A. Collier, Life University<br>
<span class="bold">ABSTRACT: </span><span class="more">Motivational Interviewing (MI) is a client-centered approach that has been used my many therapists,
clinical psychologists, and in healthcare to help clients increase self-awareness of and elicit
behavior change which is also seen in many types of coaching. MI has been proven to be effective
is many types of healthcare areas including improving physical activity and as treatment for drug
cessation. This theoretical paper presents the construct, techniques, and results generated in MI
in order to explain how and why MI is a great tool that can generalize with many forms of coaching.
Similarities and differences in MI and coaching theories, practices, processes and effects were
recorded. Results found that almost all MI constructs, techniques, and effects related to those of
client-centered coaching. Since MI is very similar to coaching and is used as a validated treatment
in healthcare, this presents great implications for the future of coaching practice.</span>

<span class="bold">TITLE: </span>Coaching Abrasive Leaders<br>
<span class="bold">AUTHOR: </span>Laura Crawshaw, The Boss Whispering Institute<br>
<span class="bold">ABSTRACT: </span><span class="more">This study explicates the theoretical bases of an empathically-grounded coaching method
designed to engage abrasive leaders in a collaborative action research process to gain insight into,
and ultimately relinquish their abrasive management styles in favor of more productive approaches.
Cases of abrasive leaders coached with this method were analyzed in relation to sociobiological,
neurobiological, and psychodynamic conceptualizations of threat, anxiety and defense, as well as the
construct of emotional management, drawn from emotional intelligence theory. Abrasive leaders were
coached to use empathy (perception and accurate interpretation of behavior) to gain insight into the
psychodynamics of their workplace interactions and the counterproductive consequences of their
aggressive management styles. Insights gained by the leaders were then used to develop interpersonal
management strategies reflecting increased emotional intelligence and decreased aggression. These
findings stand in contrast to workplace bullying theories that hold that abrasive leadership behavior
is both intractable and malevolently motivated.</span>

<p><span class="bold">TITLE: </span>“PERFECT STORM”: A Systems View of the Phenomenon of Abrasive Leadership<br>
<span class="bold">AUTHOR: </span>Lynn Harrison, Saybrook University<br>
<span class="bold">ABSTRACT: </span><span class="more">Using a systems lens, this study investigated abrasive leadership behavior. Phenomenological
inquiry explored the workplace relationship experiences of 12 formerly abrasive leaders. Through thematic
analysis, common threads in the executives’ experiences were identified, including causes of the abrasive
pattern, and what helped them to change. The study showed abrasiveness resulted from both dispositional
factors and contextual influences, creating, in effect, a perfect storm, exacerbated by limited leadership
preparation for their roles. The participants’ descriptions of their experience included a fear of failure,
frustration or betrayal, and dissonance regarding aggression in the workplace. An important distinction
highlighted was that unlike workplace bullying, the leaders’ abrasive behavior, although deleterious,
typically was not intentional; nor was it directed toward particular targets. New, more effective patterns
of leadership behavior resulted from an experience of epiphany, including revised mental models about
leadership and an increased awareness of a leader’s impact on others, supported through coaching.</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">TITLE: </span>How Purposeful Leaders View Growth<br>
<span class="bold">AUTHOR: </span>Christine Haskell, Saybrook University<br>
<span class="bold">ABSTRACT: </span><span class="more">This phenomenological study sought to understand how 19 CEOs of purposeful organizations
experienced growth activities at times they faced real challenge. Ambidexterity and business growth
cycles provided lenses for leaders’ decision-making.
Lessons from formative experiences, not formal training, were a primary influence to CEOs when considering
the unknown. A primary theme of loyalty emerged and laid the invisible fabric of group expectations: first
in the family where values were initially formed, then in the organization where values were recreated and
implemented. Feelings of fear, sadness, dread, excitement, enthusiasm underscored experiences related to
growth and protection of purpose.
Much like human and organizational lifecycles, values also have a cycle: generation, productivity,
self-deception, and re-generation. However, purposeful leaders do not do not travel the whole cycle. Thus,
they appear to weather changes differently by making decisions through the lens of creating and maintaining work
that is meaningful to them, and through self-regulation.</span></p>

<span class="bold">ABSTRACT: </span><span class="more">What goes into creating a successful system wide coach approach program in a large healthcare
organization? Introducing core coaching skills in a large healthcare organization has been extraordinarily
successful. Over 4,000 people across the system have participated in a coach approach program that is largely
delivered internally. Participants included all levels of the organization: from leaders to frontline including
all professions in the healthcare system and expanded to the non-clinical services in the organization. The impact
has been far reaching with improved communication including being more approachable, better listeners, improved
conflict-resolution, and positively impacted relationships. The infectious impacts of adopting a coach approach
program include widespread application of coaching in various contexts. Team learning and development has
exponentially increased. Improvements in team dynamics, team communication, and interpersonal relationships.
Additional application of coaching is now being introduced to patient care research and quality improvement projects.

<p><span class="bold">TITLE: </span>A Resiliency Coaching Program for College Students with Serious Psychiatric Disabilities<br>
<span class="bold">AUTHORS: </span><br>
  1) Dori S. Hutchinson, Center for Psychiatric Rehabilitation, Boston University<br>
	2) Courtney Joly-Lowdermilk, Center for Psychiatric Rehabilitation at Boston University<br>
<span class="bold">ABSTRACT: </span><span class="more">The purpose of the NITEO Coaching Program is to assist college students with serious psychiatric
disabilities on leave to identify and achieve their academic and employment goals. This project is in response to
the continued lower levels of postsecondary degree attainment in populations of individuals with psychiatric
disabilities compared to the general population. Coaching as a discipline is a dynamic, cooperative process in
which a coach inspires a client to maximize and realize their potential. Similarly, in the field of psychiatric
rehabilitation, practitioners employ coaching techniques to empower people with psychiatric disabilities to
self-determine goals and support movement toward goals. 19 young adults participated in 14 weeks of intensive
coaching at the Center for Psychiatric Rehabilitation at Boston University. By the end of the program, students’
mental health, academic self-efficacy, and rates of employment and college enrollment increased. The results of
the program are promising and warrant further study.</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">TITLE: </span>The Implications of Building Social Cohesion in Group and Leadership Coaching: A Theoretical Discussion<br>
<span class="bold">AUTHOR: </span>Liz Lasky<br>
<span class="bold">ABSTRACT: </span><span class="more">The discipline of group and leadership coaching will benefit greatly from a closer look at the intersection
between two theoretical frameworks: the theory of adolescent development and the theory of social cohesion. The
experience of being in a socially cohesive group can amplify the feelings of membership, connection, acceptance,
and success. Examining these theories will help coaches gain a deeper understanding of the power of a group and the
potential that comes with the coaching process. These theories provide direct insights into how coaching groups
ought to be run. There are specific skills that coaches can learn to promote group cohesion. This presenter will
outline, teach, and explain these methods.</span><p>

<span class="bold">TITLE: </span>The strengths and challenges of a coaching intervention for managers in Botswana<br>
<span class="bold">AUTHOR: </span>Venkata Nanduri, University of Stellenbosch Business School<br>
<span class="bold">ABSTRACT: </span><span class="more">This qualitative study was designed to understand the strengths and challenges, of coaching managers
first time in Botswana, to find answers in relation to (1) the outcomes, (2) the process, and (3) the relationship.
The participating company selected seven managers for the intervention consisting of five coaching sessions over
three months (May, June and July, 2014). For credibility and trustworthiness in this research, triangulation was
used to collect data from three independent sources – interviews from the coachee sample, interviews from the
coachees’ superiors, and the practitioner-researcher’s field notes and observations. The main finding was that the
coaching, as a development intervention for managers, has an inherent strength in helping them to actualise their
desired goal outcomes. Some challenges were experienced in the process of conducting the intervention.</span></p>
 
<p><span class="bold">TITLE: </span>Coaching Leadership for Network Cognitions and the potential for organisational impact<br>
<span class="bold">AUTHOR: </span>Sean O'Connor, Sydney University, Coaching Psychology Unit<br>
<span class="bold">ABSTRACT: </span><span class="more">Given that leaders are embedded in complex networks of interaction it may be important to consider the
potential for broader level systemic impact of change that begins at the individual cognitions of a leader.
Preliminary research has shown that Cognitive behavioural coaching can have an impact on the well-being of members,
beyond those coached directly, through the coaching ripple effect (O'Connor and Cavanagh, 2013). Additionally evidence
supports the idea that certain types of leaders have more effective network cognitions which can be related to the
team effectiveness. This presentation reports recently published research on changes observed in the relational
networks of an organisation following a coaching intervention and discusses current research on individual leader
network cognitions. Further to this insight is provided in to the potential for cognitive behavioural coaching
approaches working directly with the network cognitions of leaders potentially improving their leadership
effectiveness and the quality of their impact on others.</span><p>

<p><span class="bold">TITLE:</span> Widening the Lens of Leadership: Toward Advancing Leadership Coaching as a Specialty<br>
<span class="bold">AUTHOR: </span> Ken Otter, Saint Mary's College of California<br>
<span class="bold">ABSTRACT: </span><span class="more">Coaching is increasingly employed as an important pathway for leadership development. Indeed, leadership
coaching is beginning to emerge as a distinct specialty within the field of coaching. Key to its maturation,
leadership coaching needs to engage the practical knowledge of both coaching and leadership.  Yet, a critical
review of the literature in leadership coaching reveals surprisingly little engagement with the field of leadership.
Moreover, the view of leadership that is presented is a rather narrow view and not reflective of the diversity and
range of perspectives in the field. Following the review of the literature, the paper presents four trends in
contemporary leadership theory intended to enhance the leadership literacy in coaches and to inform practice. The
paper concludes with recommendations for future actions to enhance the development of leadership coaching as a
viable coaching specialty.</span></p>

<span class="bold">ABSTRACT: </span><span class="more">This article describes findings from a case study conducted with twelve internal coaches in one school
Federation in England from 2008-2010. The purpose of the study was to explore the benefits and challenges of
implementing a coaching programme delivered by educators for educators responsible for teaching emotional intelligence
(EI) skills to students. Twelve internal educators participated in a yearlong coach certification and delivery process
grounded in EI theory and skills (Brackett, Rivers, and Salovey, 2011; Salovey and Mayer, 1990; Zins and Elias, 2007.
Data collection included pre and post interviews and online reports for both coaches-in-training and clients.  Findings
revealed : deeper commitment to teaching EI skills, increases in self-awareness and self-management, and improved
relationships with adults and young people. While both coaches and clients reported positive behavioural changes, the
lack of support at the leadership level was found to negatively impact successful implementation.</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">TITLE: </span>Coaching for employee engagement: Using self-determination theory to predict work engagement, turnover
 intentions and wellbeing among employees<br>
<span class="bold">AUTHORS: </span><br>
  1) Gordon Spence, Sydney Business School, University of Wollongong<br>
	2) Dr. Christopher P. Niemiec, University of Rochester, NY<br>
<span class="bold">ABSTRACT: </span> <span class="more">Employee engagement continues to be an area of great interest for business leaders, organisational scholars, and
coaching practitioners. Surprisingly, few studies have sought to understand if and how coaching might impact engagement.
In this talk Dr. Spence will share key findings from a large-scale coaching trial that investigated the impact of need
supportive coaching on engagement within the work domain. Informed by self-determination theory (SDT), the study tested
several hypotheses related to a core prediction that need supportive coaching would facilitate employee engagement through
the satisfaction of basic psychological needs (i.e. autonomy, competence and relatedness) and autonomous work motivation.
A total of 107 participants (50 coaching; 57 control) took part in a 10-week coaching intervention that comprised 5 x
60-minute individual coaching sessions. As hypothesised, need supportive coaching was found to facilitate the
internalisation of important work goals, with increases in relative autonomy predicting increases in work engagement
(through increases in perceived competence). Other positive efforts were also observed for other work and wellbeing
variables (such as intention to quit, somatisation, and mental ill-health). The implications of these results for coaching
practice will be discussed, along with future research directions.</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">TITLE: </span>Increasing Work-Life Integration and Decreasing Sense of Overwhelm through a Group Coaching Intervention<br>
<span class="bold">AUTHOR: </span>Monique Valcour, EDHEC Business School
<span class="bold">ABSTRACT: </span> <span class="more">This paper examines the development, implementation and effectiveness of a group coaching program to combat a
sense of overwhelm and to achieve desired work-life integration. Results suggest the program was effective in enabling
participants to overcome the most common sources of work-life conflict and overwhelm in managerial and professional work
and in developing and implementing strategies to reduce overwhelm and increase work effectiveness, work-life integration
and life satisfaction.</span><p>

<span class="bold">ABSTRACT:</span> <span class="more">The pressing need to manage burgeoning chronic disease has led to the emergence of new job roles including
health and wellness coaches (HWC). As use of these titles has increased dramatically, so has the need to ensure
consistency, quality and safety for HW coaching provided in both practice and research. Clear and uniform role
definitions and competencies are required to ensure appropriate scope of practice, to allow best practices to emerge,
and to support the implementation of well-designed, large scale studies to accumulate a rigorous evidence base. Since
the nascent field is replete with heterogeneity in terms of role delineations and competencies, a collaborative volunteer
non-profit organization, the National Consortium for Credentialing Health and Wellness Coaches (NCCHWC), has been built
over the past five years to support professionalization of the field. This paper presents specific findings from the Job
Task Analysis undertaken by the NCCHWC to delineate the role of HWC.</span></p>
