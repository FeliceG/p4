     <span class="bold">AUTHOR: </span> Renata Arrepia<br>
     <span class="bold">ABSTRACT: </span>  <span class="more">This project aims to measure the influence of career coaching in the
       life of the student during the period of training in: self-knowledge, increase in the level of expectation and self-confidence,
       motivation and buoyancy to the achievement of the plans, preparation of the individual to take action and begin to develop towards
       the desired goals in his career. Also, to get him close to a coaching process, which for many students is still unknown, thus
       causing the desire for continuous improvement and the pursuit of coaching programs, like life, business, executive, among others.

     <p><span class="bold">TITLE:</span> :  The 4C Dynamic Model: Constructing SME Leaders' Professional Identity Through Developmental
       Coaching<br>
     <span class="bold">AUTHOR:</span> <br>

     <span class="bold">ABSTRACT:</span> <span class="more">SMEs are of economic importance. An alignment exists between the business’
       sustainability and growth, and the capacities of its managers. SME managers are reluctant regarding traditional training, they
       consider the latter as inadequate. The constructivist approach to professional development, such as coaching, even though well
       adapted for SME leaders, is under utilized due to ignorance, doubt based on service quality, or because it is not part of culture.
       Still today, little attention has been given to research that highlights the importance of coaching regarding identity construction
       and development of entrepreneur leaders. Our goal is to fulfill those gaps. After conducting a literature review, we propose a
       conceptual model representative of the identity construction process stimulated by coaching and context that takes into account
       four professional identity's dimensions: controllability, consciousness, competencies, and coherency. The proposed model could
       be applicable to SME leaders, but also managers of larger organizations and professionals.</span></p>


     <p><span class="bold">TITLE: </span>Learning by Doing: Coaching Physicians for Patient-Centered Care<br>
     <span class="bold">AUTHORS: </span>Sharon Badgett-Lichten, Massachusetts General Hospital<br>
     <span class="bold">ABSTRACT: </span><span class="more">Massachusetts General Hospital conducts surveys of its patients and has set
       specific goals to improve physician communication with patients. As providers have reviewed their individual scores, there have
       been requests for tactics that could help providers in improving their communication. As we reflected on how to provide physicians
       with the support they are requesting, the idea of observing interactions and coaching physicians was brought forward. The hypothesis
       was that engaging with willing providers in a structured observation and coaching program could meaningfully improve physician
       communication skills. The entire provider staff of an MGH specialty practice-seven physicians, including the Unit Chief-participated
       in and completed the physician communication observation and coaching program from October, 2013 through April 2014. Given the notable
       increase in survey scores in this specialty practice, our findings suggest that the communication observation and coaching program is
       an effective intervention to improve physician communication skills.</span>
